Databases
---------

Often times, applications need to talk to some external datasource. This
section will cover recipes for integrating different types of databases
into your Sinatra application. This section won't cover the differences
between the types of databases your application may want to use, it will
just list a few recipes for connecting to and using data in some of those
databases. For a discussion of the different types of databases out there
you can consult [this Wikipedia article][database_on_wikipedia].

## Did we miss something?

It's very possible we've left something out, thats why we need your help! This
is a community driven project after all. Feel free to fork the project and send
us a pull request to get your recipe or tutorial included in the book.
