Middleware
----------

Rack is the interface behind Sinatra, and many other Ruby web frameworks. This section will cover middleware supported by Rack and Sinatra. Take a look at the [Sinatra README][middleware-readme] and [Sinatra Book][middleware-book] for more on Rack middleware.

## Did we miss something?

It's very possible we've left something out, thats why we need your help! This
is a community driven project after all. Feel free to fork the project and send
us a pull request to get your recipe or tutorial included in the book. 

See the [README][readme] for more details.
