Models
------

Models are a common pattern for abstracting your data out into an
Object-relational mapper or other low-level interface for data transport. This
section will cover recipes for integrating these into your Sinatra
application. The suggested practice for this is using
[datamapper][datamapper], which is covered in the [book][models].

## Did we miss something?

It's very possible we've left something out, thats why we need your help! This
is a community driven project after all. Feel free to fork the project and send
us a pull request to get your recipe or tutorial included in the book. 

See the [README][readme] for more details.
