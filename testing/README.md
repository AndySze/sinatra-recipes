Testing
-------

Testing is an important part of building and designing applications. Sinatra is no exception, and there are more than a few ways to test your application.

This section will cover most of these, along with the [book][testing-book] and [readme][testing-readme].

## Did we miss something?

It's very possible we've left something out, thats why we need your help! This
is a community driven project after all. Feel free to fork the project and send
us a pull request to get your recipe or tutorial included in the book. 

See the [README][readme] for more details.
