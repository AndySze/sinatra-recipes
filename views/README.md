Sinatra is built upon a very powerful templating engine, [Tilt][tilt].

This enables you to do all sorts of fun and exciting things to display your views. In this section we will cover some of them, along with the [book][views-book].

Also, be sure to read up the [readme][views-readme] first to cover the basics and what's possible within Sinatra itself.

## Did we miss something?

It's very possible we've left something out, thats why we need your help! This
is a community driven project after all. Feel free to fork the project and send
us a pull request to get your recipe or tutorial included in the book. 

See the [README][readme] for more details.
